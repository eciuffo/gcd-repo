subject `- This column contains the subject to whom measures were taken. Since we had 30 participants, this column contains participants 1 through 30

activity - This column contains the activity name for each activity performed by each participant. Each observation contains one of the possible values:
WALKING, 
WALKING_UPSTAIRS,
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, 
SITTING,
STANDING
LAYING

 Measures are columns containing the average of one of the possible measures computed per activity/subject pair. Below the list of columns:

The columns above represent all possible measures taken and they could be broken dows into The Domain,  the namee of the measure, and the type of measure. All separated by the "-" character. They were not split by DOmain/name and type of measure as this was not needed to accomplish the requested result.

The following were the transformations applied to thease measures (features):

# Edit features vector to separate Domains by adding  "-" after first character
featureVector <- sub("^f","f-",features$V2,)
featureVector <- sub("^t","t-",featureVector,)

# Creating Domain "at" meaning "angle t", aX, aY and aZ meaning "angle X, Y and Z"
featureVector <- sub("angle\\(t","at-",featureVector,)
featureVector <- sub("angle\\(X","aX-",featureVector,)
featureVector <- sub("angle\\(Y","aY-",featureVector,)
featureVector <- sub("angle\\(Z","aZ-",featureVector,)

# Removing "," character from names
featureVector <- sub("\\,","",featureVector,)

# removing "(", ")" characters from feature names
featureVector <- gsub("\\(","",featureVector,)
featureVector <- gsub("\\)","",featureVector,)

# Separating the word "Mean" from the feature name
featureVector <- sub("[a-z]Mean$","-mean",featureVector,)

Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set 
Download: Data Folder, Data Set Description

Data Set Information:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.
